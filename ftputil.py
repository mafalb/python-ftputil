ftputil - high-level FTP client library

FTPHost objects
    This class resembles the `os` module's interface to ordinary file
    systems. In addition, it provides a method `file` which will
    return file-objects corresponding to remote files.

    # example session
    host = ftputil.FTPHost('ftp.domain.com', 'me', 'secret')
    print host.getcwd()  # e. g. '/home/me'
    source = host.file('sourcefile', 'r')
    host.mkdir('newdir')
    host.chdir('newdir')
    target = host.file('targetfile', 'w')
    host.copyfileobj(source, target)
    source.close()
    target.close()
    host.remove('targetfile')
    host.chdir(host.pardir)
    host.rmdir('newdir')
    host.close()

    There are also shortcuts for uploads and downloads:

    host.upload(local_file, remote_file)
    host.download(remote_file, local_file)

    Both accept an additional mode parameter. If it is 'b', the
    transfer mode will be for binary files.

    For even more functionality refer to the documentation in
    `ftputil.txt`.

FTPFile objects
    `FTPFile` objects are constructed via the `file` method (`open`
    is an alias) of `FTPHost` objects. `FTPFile` objects support the
    usual file operations for non-seekable files (`read`, `readline`,
    `readlines`, `xreadlines`, `write`, `writelines`, `close`).

Note: ftputil currently is not threadsafe. More specifically, you can
      use different `FTPHost` objects in different threads but not
      using a single `FTPHost` object in different threads.

# `FTPHost` class with several methods similar to those of `os`

class FTPHost:
    """FTP host class."""

    # Implementation notes:
    #
    # Upon every request of a file (`_FTPFile` object) a new FTP
    # session is created ("cloned"), leading to a child session of
    # the `FTPHost` object from which the file is requested.
    #
    # This is needed because opening an `_FTPFile` will make the
    # local session object wait for the completion of the transfer.
    # In fact, code like this would block indefinitely, if the `RETR`
    # request would be made on the `_session` of the object host:
    #
    #   host = FTPHost(ftp_server, user, password)
    #   f = host.file('index.html')
    #   host.getcwd()   # would block!
    #
    # On the other hand, the initially constructed host object will
    # store references to already established `_FTPFile` objects and
    # reuse an associated connection if its associated `_FTPFile`
    # has been closed.

        call to the FTP server's `RMD` command, thus often allowing

        `_remove_only_empty=False` and `rmdir` will delegate to the
        FTP server, as before. Note, however, that deleting non-empty
        directories may be disallowed in future versions of ftputil.
