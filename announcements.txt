ftputil 1.1 is released. You can find it at
http://www.ndh.net/home/sschwarzer/python/python_software.html .

ftputil provides a higher-level interface for FTP sessions than the
ftplib module. FTP servers can be accessed via an interface similar to
os and os.path. Remote files are accessible as file-like objects.

New since version 1.0:

- ftputil now runs under Python 2.1+ (not only 2.2+).
- documentation
- conditional upload/download (depending on local and remote file
  timestamps)
- FTPHost.stat follows links
- a session factory other than the default, ftplib.FTP, can be given
  in the FTPHost constructor; this allows to use classes like
  ftpslib.FTP_TLS from the M2Crypto package
- several bugfixes (mostly regarding byte count in text mode
  transfers)
- unit test

Hello Pythoneers :)

I would like to announce ftputil.py, a module which provides a
more friendly interface for FTP sessions than the ftplib module.

The FTPHost objects generated from it allow many operations similar
to those of os and os.path. Examples:

  # download some files from the login directory
  import ftputil
  host = ftputil.FTPHost('ftp.domain.com', 'user', 'secret')
  names = host.listdir(host.curdir)
  for name in names:
      if host.path.isreg(name):
          host.download(name, name, 'b')  # remote, local, binary mode

  # make a new directory and copy a remote file into it
  host.mkdir('newdir')
  source = host.file('index.html', 'r')  # file-like object
  target = host.file('newdir/index.html', 'w')  # file-like object
  host.copyfileobj(source, target)  # mimics shutil.copyfileobj
  source.close()
  target.close()

Even host.path.walk works. :-) But slow. ;-)

ftputil.py can be downloaded from
http://www.ndh.net/home/sschwarzer/download/ftputil.py

I would like to get your suggestions and comments. :-)

P.S.: Thanks to Pedro Rodriguez for his helpful answer to my question
in comp.lang.python :-)
