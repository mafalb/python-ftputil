Here's ftputil 2.0 !

ftputil is a high-level alternative to Python's ftplib module. With
ftputil, you can access directories and files on remote FTP servers
almost as if they were in your local file system. This includes using
file-like objects representing remote files.

You can download ftputil from

http://www.sschwarzer.net/download/ftputil-2.0.tar.gz

What's new?
-----------

From version 1.1 to 2.0, the following has changed:

- ftputil has been re-organized and is now a Python package (the
  import statement is still the same)

- installation via Python distutils

- stat, upload_if_newer, download_if_newer etc. work correctly if the
  server is in another time zone than the client running ftputil (with
  help from Andrew Ittner); see section "Time zone correction" in the
  documentation

- it's possible to set the directory listing format "manually" (though
  in most cases it's recognized automatically); see section "Stat'ing
  files and directories"

- added a workaround regarding whitespace in directory names (thanks
  to Tommy Sundström and H. Y. Chu)

- extended documentation and converted it to HTML format (now
  generated from reStructured Text)

- several bugfixes

- there's now a mailing list at http://codespeak.net/mailman/listinfo/ftputil
  (thanks to Holger Krekel)

Documentation
-------------

The documentation for ftputil can be found in the file ftputil.txt
(reStructured Text format) or ftputil.html (recommended, generated
from ftputil.txt).

ftputil 1.1 is released. You can find it at
http://www.ndh.net/home/sschwarzer/python/python_software.html .

ftputil provides a higher-level interface for FTP sessions than the
ftplib module. FTP servers can be accessed via an interface similar to
os and os.path. Remote files are accessible as file-like objects.

New since version 1.0:

- ftputil now runs under Python 2.1+ (not only 2.2+).
- documentation
- conditional upload/download (depending on local and remote file
  timestamps)
- FTPHost.stat follows links
- a session factory other than the default, ftplib.FTP, can be given
  in the FTPHost constructor; this allows to use classes derived from
  ftplib.FTP (like ftpslib.FTP_TLS from the M2Crypto package)
- several bugfixes (mostly regarding byte count in text mode
  transfers)
- unit test

Hello Pythoneers :)

I would like to announce ftputil.py, a module which provides a
more friendly interface for FTP sessions than the ftplib module.

The FTPHost objects generated from it allow many operations similar
to those of os and os.path. Examples:

  # download some files from the login directory
  import ftputil
  host = ftputil.FTPHost('ftp.domain.com', 'user', 'secret')
  names = host.listdir(host.curdir)
  for name in names:
      if host.path.isreg(name):
          host.download(name, name, 'b')  # remote, local, binary mode

  # make a new directory and copy a remote file into it
  host.mkdir('newdir')
  source = host.file('index.html', 'r')  # file-like object
  target = host.file('newdir/index.html', 'w')  # file-like object
  host.copyfileobj(source, target)  # mimics shutil.copyfileobj
  source.close()
  target.close()

Even host.path.walk works. :-) But slow. ;-)

ftputil.py can be downloaded from
http://www.ndh.net/home/sschwarzer/download/ftputil.py

I would like to get your suggestions and comments. :-)

P.S.: Thanks to Pedro Rodriguez for his helpful answer to my question
in comp.lang.python :-)
