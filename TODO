Planned:

- get ftputil included into Debian repositories
- add `ftp_session` module containing session classes (e. g. for
  passive mode connections)

Ideas for future development:

- add an interface module for ftpparse (see conversation with
  Oleg Broytmann) -> perhaps license issues
- WebDAV support?
