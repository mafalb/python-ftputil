Planned features:

- write a ftputil_mirror.py script
  a) as a usage example of ftputil
  b) for benchmarking
  c) as a useful tool
- caching of `FTPHost.stat` results; policy?
- support more directory formats (see mails from Oleg Broytmann)
- support time resolution in stat results (Oleg Broytmann)
- add `ftp_session` module containing session classes (e. g. for
  passive mode connections)

Ideas for future development:

- handle connection timeouts (Antonio Beamud Montero)
- merge with vpath project (Holger Krekel)
- merge in WebDAV support
- what about thread safety? (also have a look at `ftplib`)
- map FTP error numbers to os error numbers (ENOENT etc.)?
