ftputil
=======

Purpose
-------

ftputil is a high-level FTP client library for the Python programming
language. ftputil implements a virtual file system for accessing FTP
servers, that is, it can generate file-like objects for remote files.
The library supports many functions similar to those in the os,
os.path and shutil modules. ftputil has convenience functions for
conditional uploads and downloads, and handles FTP clients and servers
in different timezones.

What's new?
-----------

This release fixes a bug in the ``makedirs`` call (report and fix by
Julian, whose last name I don't know ;-) ). Upgrading is recommended.

Documentation
-------------

The documentation for ftputil can be found in the file ftputil.txt
(reStructuredText format) or ftputil.html (recommended, generated
from ftputil.txt).

Prerequisites
-------------

To use ftputil, you need Python, at least version 2.3. Python is a
programming language, available from http://www.python.org for free.

Installation
------------

- *If you have an older version of ftputil installed, delete it or move
  it somewhere else, so that it doesn't conflict with the new version!*

- Unpack the archive file containing the distribution files. If you
  had an hypothetical ftputil version 1.2, you would type at the shell
  prompt:

    tar xzf ftputil-1.2.tar.gz

  However, if you read this, you probably unpacked the archive already. ;-)

- Make the directory to where the files were unpacked your current directory.
  Consider that after unpacking, you have a directory ftputil-1.2. Make it
  the current directory with

    cd ftputil-1.2

- Type

    python setup.py install

  at the shell prompt. On Unix/Linux, you have to be root to perform the
  installation. Likewise, you have to be logged in as administrator if you
  install on Windows.

  If you want to customize the installation paths, please read
  http://docs.python.org/inst/inst.html .
