"""a simple LRU (Least-Recently-Used) cache module

This module provides very simple LRU (Least-Recently-Used) cache
functionality.

An *in-memory cache* is useful for storing the results of an
'expensive' process (one that takes a lot of time or resources) for
later re-use. Typical examples are accessing data from the filesystem,
a database, or a network location. If you know you'll need to re-read
the data again, it can help to keep it in a cache.

You *can* use a Python dictionary as a cache for some purposes.
However, if the results you're caching are large, or you have a lot of
possible results, this can be impractical memory-wise.

An *LRU cache*, on the other hand, only keeps _some_ of the results in
memory, which keeps you from overusing resources. The cache is bounded
by a maximum size; if you try to add more values to the cache, it will
automatically discard the values that you haven't read or written to
in the longest time. In other words, the least-recently-used items are
discarded. [1]_

.. [1]: 'Discarded' here means 'removed from the cache'.

    Instances of this class provide a least-recently-used (LRU) cache. They
    emulate a Python mapping type. You can use an LRU cache more or less like
    a Python dictionary, with the exception that objects you put into the
    cache may be discarded before you take them out.

    Some example usage::

    cache = LRUCache(32) # new cache
    cache['foo'] = get_file_contents('foo') # or whatever

        # use cached version

        contents = get_file_contents('foo')
        # store in cache for next time
        cache['foo'] = contents

    print cache.size # Maximum size

    print len(cache) # 0 <= len(cache) <= cache.size

    cache.size = 10 # Auto-shrink on size assignment
